# Animation Cleanup - Reduced Shaking

## ✅ Changes Made to Reduce Shaking

### **BoxAnimationController.cs - Disabled Visual Effects**
```csharp
[Header("Visual Effects")]
public bool usePulseOnSpawn = false; // ❌ Disabled - was causing shaking
public bool useShakeOnSettle = false; // ❌ Disabled - was causing shaking
```

### **BoxFacialExpressions.cs - Disabled Shaking Effects**
```csharp
[Header("Visual Effects")]
public bool useShakeOnScared = false; // ❌ Disabled - was causing shaking
public bool useTearsOnFalling = false; // ❌ Disabled - was causing shaking
public bool useBlinking = true; // ✅ Kept - facial expression only
```

## 🎭 What's Still Active

### **✅ Facial Expressions (Still Working)**
- **Scared Expression**: When box is at spawner
- **Screaming Expression**: When box is falling  
- **Relaxed Expression**: When box is settled
- **Blinking**: Subtle eye blinking animation

### **✅ Animator Controller (Still Working)**
- **BoxSpawned**: Animation state when spawned
- **BoxFalling**: Animation state when falling
- **BoxSettled**: Animation state when settled

## ❌ What's Disabled

### **❌ Shaking Effects**
- **Pulse Animation**: Box pulsing when spawned
- **Settle Shake**: Box shaking when landing
- **Scared Shake**: Facial features shaking when scared
- **Tear Drops**: Tears falling during falling state

### **❌ Debug Logs**
- Removed all debug logs for cleaner console
- Scale tracking logs removed (issue was fixed)

## 🎮 Result

### **Before:**
- Lots of shaking and movement
- Pulse effects on spawn
- Shake effects on landing
- Tear drops falling
- Facial features shaking

### **After:**
- **Smooth, stable boxes** ✅
- **Only facial expressions** ✅
- **No shaking or pulsing** ✅
- **Clean, focused gameplay** ✅

## 🔧 How to Re-enable (If Needed)

### **Re-enable Pulse Animation:**
```csharp
// In BoxAnimationController component
usePulseOnSpawn = true;
```

### **Re-enable Settle Shake:**
```csharp
// In BoxAnimationController component
useShakeOnSettle = true;
```

### **Re-enable Facial Shaking:**
```csharp
// In BoxFacialExpressions component
useShakeOnScared = true;
useTearsOnFalling = true;
```

## 🎯 Current Experience

Now the game should have:
1. **Stable boxes** that don't shake or pulse
2. **Clear facial expressions** that change based on state
3. **Smooth animations** without distracting effects
4. **Focused gameplay** without visual noise

The boxes will still show their emotions through facial expressions, but without any shaking or movement that could be distracting! 🎮✨
