# Box Scale Fix Guide

## Issue: Box Spawning with Scale (0,0,0)

### Problem Description
- Box appears in scene but has scale (0,0,0)
- Prefab has correct scale but spawned box doesn't
- Box appears as a "blue line" or invisible

### Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. **EnhancedBoxBorder script** modifying the box scale
2. **Visual enhancements** not preserving original scale
3. **Instantiation** not maintaining prefab scale

### âœ… Solution Applied

#### 1. Fixed BoxSpawner.cs
```csharp
// Before visual enhancements
Vector3 originalScale = boxToSpawn.transform.localScale;
currentBox.transform.localScale = originalScale;

// After visual enhancements
currentBox.transform.localScale = originalScale;
```

#### 2. Fixed EnhancedBoxBorder.cs
```csharp
// Ensure parent scale is preserved
if (transform.localScale != Vector3.one)
{
    float parentScale = Mathf.Max(transform.localScale.x, transform.localScale.y, transform.localScale.z);
    borderObject.transform.localScale = Vector3.one * (1f + borderWidth * 2 / parentScale);
}
```

## Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Check Prefab Scale
1. **Select your box prefab**
2. **Check Transform scale** - should be (1,1,1) or your desired scale
3. **Note the scale values**

### Step 2: Test in Play Mode
1. **Enter Play mode**
2. **Spawn a box**
3. **Check Console** for debug message showing scale values
4. **Verify box appears with correct size**

### Step 3: If Still Not Working
1. **Check if BoxVariations is assigned** in BoxSpawner
2. **Disable autoApplyBorders** in BoxVariations if needed
3. **Test without visual enhancements** first

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Disable Visual Enhancements Temporarily
```csharp
// In BoxVariations component
autoApplyBorders = false;
```

### Option 2: Manual Scale Fix
```csharp
// In BoxSpawner.SpawnNewBoxCoroutine()
currentBox.transform.localScale = new Vector3(1f, 1f, 1f);
```

### Option 3: Check Box Prefab Structure
```
Box Prefab should have:
â”œâ”€â”€ Main Box (scale: 1,1,1)
â”œâ”€â”€ Eyes (Child, scale: 1,1,1)
â””â”€â”€ Mouth (Child, scale: 1,1,1)
```

## Debug Information

### Console Messages
Look for this debug message in Console:
```
Box spawned with scale: (1,1,1), Original prefab scale: (1,1,1)
```

### Expected Values
- **Prefab scale**: Should be (1,1,1) or your desired scale
- **Spawned box scale**: Should match prefab scale
- **If different**: Check what's modifying the scale

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: BoxVariations Not Assigned
```
Solution:
1. Select BoxSpawner in scene
2. Assign BoxVariations component to "Box Variations" field
3. Or disable BoxVariations system temporarily
```

### Issue 2: EnhancedBoxBorder Modifying Scale
```
Solution:
1. Check if EnhancedBoxBorder script is on box prefab
2. Verify CreateBorder() method isn't changing scale
3. Disable enhancePhysics if causing issues
```

### Issue 3: Child Objects Affecting Scale
```
Solution:
1. Check Eyes and Mouth child objects
2. Ensure they have scale (1,1,1)
3. Verify they're not affecting parent scale
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Box prefab has correct scale
- [ ] Box spawns with correct scale in Play mode
- [ ] Console shows correct scale values
- [ ] Box is visible and properly sized
- [ ] Facial expressions are visible
- [ ] No scale-related errors in Console

## Performance Note

The scale fix adds minimal overhead:
- **One Vector3 assignment** per box spawn
- **One debug log** per box spawn
- **No impact on gameplay performance**

## Final Result

After applying the fix:
1. **Boxes spawn with correct scale**
2. **Visual enhancements work properly**
3. **Facial expressions are visible**
4. **No more "blue line" issue**

The scale issue should now be resolved! ðŸŽ®âœ¨
