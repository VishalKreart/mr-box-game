# Scale Debug Guide - Log vs Inspector Mismatch

## Issue: Log Shows Correct Scale, Inspector Shows 0

### Problem Description
- Console log shows correct scale values (e.g., 1,1,1)
- Inspector shows scale as (0,0,0)
- Box appears invisible or as "blue line"

### Root Cause
The issue is caused by the **PulseAnimation coroutine** in `BoxAnimationController`:
1. **Box spawns** with correct scale
2. **PulseAnimation starts** and captures scale
3. **PulseAnimation modifies** scale during animation
4. **Scale gets set to 0** or incorrect value

### ‚úÖ Solution Applied

#### 1. Fixed BoxAnimationController.cs
```csharp
// Removed scale capture from Start() method
// Now captures scale when PulseAnimation starts
// Added fallback to Vector3.one if scale is 0
```

#### 2. Added Debug Logs
```csharp
// Added debug logs to track scale changes:
// - When PlaySpawnedAnimation is called
// - When PulseAnimation starts
// - When PulseAnimation finishes
```

## Debug Steps

### Step 1: Check Console Logs
Look for these debug messages in Console:
```
Box spawned with scale: (1,1,1), Original prefab scale: (1,1,1)
After ForceSpawnedState - Box scale: (1,1,1)
Final box scale: (1,1,1)
PlaySpawnedAnimation called - Current scale: (1,1,1)
Starting PulseAnimation - Scale before: (1,1,1)
PulseAnimation started - Captured scale: (1,1,1)
PulseAnimation finished - Final scale: (1,1,1)
```

### Step 2: Identify When Scale Changes
If you see scale changing to 0, it's happening in:
- **PulseAnimation coroutine**
- **Facial expressions script**
- **Visual enhancements**

### Step 3: Quick Fix Options

#### Option 1: Disable Pulse Animation
```csharp
// In BoxAnimationController component
usePulseOnSpawn = false;
```

#### Option 2: Disable All Visual Effects
```csharp
// In BoxAnimationController component
usePulseOnSpawn = false;
useShakeOnSettle = false;

// In BoxFacialExpressions component
useShakeOnScared = false;
useTearsOnFalling = false;
useBlinking = false;
```

#### Option 3: Force Scale After Animation
```csharp
// Add this to BoxSpawner after spawning
Invoke("ForceBoxScale", 0.1f);

public void ForceBoxScale()
{
    if (currentBox != null)
    {
        currentBox.transform.localScale = Vector3.one;
    }
}
```

## Testing Procedure

### 1. Basic Test
```
1. Enter Play mode
2. Spawn a box
3. Check Console for debug messages
4. Check Inspector scale values
5. Note when scale changes to 0
```

### 2. Disable Effects Test
```
1. Disable usePulseOnSpawn in BoxAnimationController
2. Spawn a box
3. Check if scale remains correct
4. If yes, the issue is in PulseAnimation
```

### 3. Step-by-Step Debug
```
1. Check scale after instantiation
2. Check scale after visual enhancements
3. Check scale after ForceSpawnedState
4. Check scale during PulseAnimation
5. Check scale after PulseAnimation
```

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Scale Changes During PulseAnimation
```
Solution: The fix should handle this now
- PulseAnimation captures correct scale
- Uses fallback if scale is 0
- Restores scale at the end
```

### Scenario 2: Scale Changes in Facial Expressions
```
Solution: Check BoxFacialExpressions script
- Look for any scale modifications
- Check if child objects affect parent scale
```

### Scenario 3: Scale Changes in Visual Enhancements
```
Solution: Check EnhancedBoxBorder script
- Verify it doesn't modify parent scale
- Check if borders affect main object
```

## Quick Fix Checklist

- [ ] Check Console for debug messages
- [ ] Identify when scale changes to 0
- [ ] Disable PulseAnimation if causing issues
- [ ] Test with minimal effects
- [ ] Verify box appears with correct scale
- [ ] Re-enable effects one by one

## Expected Debug Output

### Normal Operation:
```
Box spawned with scale: (1,1,1), Original prefab scale: (1,1,1)
After ForceSpawnedState - Box scale: (1,1,1)
Final box scale: (1,1,1)
PlaySpawnedAnimation called - Current scale: (1,1,1)
Starting PulseAnimation - Scale before: (1,1,1)
PulseAnimation started - Captured scale: (1,1,1)
PulseAnimation finished - Final scale: (1,1,1)
```

### If Scale Changes to 0:
```
Box spawned with scale: (1,1,1), Original prefab scale: (1,1,1)
After ForceSpawnedState - Box scale: (1,1,1)
Final box scale: (1,1,1)
PlaySpawnedAnimation called - Current scale: (1,1,1)
Starting PulseAnimation - Scale before: (1,1,1)
PulseAnimation started - Captured scale: (0,0,0)  ‚Üê Problem here
Scale was 0, set to: (1,1,1)
PulseAnimation finished - Final scale: (1,1,1)
```

## Final Result

After the fix:
1. **Scale should remain consistent** throughout the process
2. **PulseAnimation should not break** the scale
3. **Box should be visible** with correct size
4. **Debug logs should show** consistent scale values

The scale issue should now be resolved! üéÆ‚ú®
